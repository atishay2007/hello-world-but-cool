# Hello World... but Cooler 😎

This is my first ever GitHub repo.  
The classic "Hello World", but with a bit of college energy.

---

## 💡 What's inside?
- A "Hello World" message that proves I exist in the coding universe
- 0 bugs (so far)
- A sprinkle of *masti*

---

## 🖥 How to run it
1. Download this repo  
2. Open the file in your favourite editor  
3. See the magic (and yes, it's just "Hello World")

---

## 🚀 Why this repo?
Because tradition says the first repo must be a Hello World.  
And who am I to break ancient coding rituals?

⭐️ Fun fact: Writing this took longer than the actual code.
